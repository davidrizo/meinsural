# MEIÂ·nsural
This catalog catalog contains a list of notation examples encoded using [Music Encoding Initiative (MEI)](https://music-encoding.org) format as they are encoded by the OMR Tool [MuRET](https://github.com/HISPAMUS/muret).
*In the future this repository will be merged with the MuRET documentation (still private).*
